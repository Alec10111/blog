As the subtitle of the blog says, Im a washed up mathematician turned programmer.

I Graduated in Mathematics at the University of Malaga and redirected my career towards programming.
During University I gave programming lessons to other graduate students in Scala and Haskell.
I’m currently working as Backend Developer at Cathedral Software.

I enjoy learning new technologies and I’m always up for the challenge of acquiring new skills.
