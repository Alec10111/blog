My name is Carlos and I am 25. Graduated in Mathematics at the University of Malaga. I specialise in Algebra, Topology and Programming.

I have been giving programming lessons to other graduate students in Scala and Haskell.

I’m currently working as Backend Developer at Cathedral Software in Malaga, Spain.

I enjoy learning new technologies and I’m always up for the challenge of acquiring new skills.
